    <p> 
        <em>Jellied Moose Nose</em> is a Canadian <s>abomination</s> delicacy
        made of cut up moose nose and gelatinized broth.
        <br>
            Dating as far back to a cookbook made in 1967, <em>Jellied Moose Nose</em> has been a staple of Canadian
            cuisine ever since.

        It has been described by Chef Andrew Zimmern as a dish exploding "with little tastes".
